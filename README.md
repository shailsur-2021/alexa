### This skill is part of the Alexa Skill Development Workshop

### Steps to importing and running this Skill

1) Sign up for an Alexa developer account - https://developer.amazon.com/docs/app-submission/manage-account-and-permissions.html#create_account

2) Sign up for a Spoonacular API account - https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Dashboard

### Step 1: Import and update Code from Github

1) Go to Alexa console, under Skills, click _Create skill_. Enter a Skill Name as _Meal Planner_. Leave _English (US)_ as the default language. Choose Custom under _Choose a model to add to your skill_. Choose Alexa-hosted (Node.js) under _Choose a method to host your skill's backend resources_. Click _Create Skill_.

2) In the next page that opens up, choose _Start From Scratch_. Click _Import Skill_. In the dialog that opens up, provide the URL of this git repository https://github.com/shailsur-2021/alexa.git.

3) Once the code is imported successfuly, click on the newly imported _Meal Planner_ skill.

4) Next, click on the Invocation menu under Build menu on the left navigation. Customize the invocation to anything that resonates with you, e.g., '_plan my meal'_. This phrase becomes your Meal Planner Skill invocation.

5) Click on Save Model to save your invocation phrase.

### Step 2: Explore intent and slots that capture information
Now let's explore the skill's front end. Remember, an intent is an action to fulfill a user's request. An utterance is what invokes the intent.  In this case, the intent is going to capture the user's meal planning request.

1) Click on the Build menu. Expand the Interaction Model on the left navigation, then expand Intents. Click on MealIntent. Examine the _Sample utterances_.

2) Explore the Slots. Click on _maxcalories_ and _diet_ under MealIntent on the left navigation. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76848465/115781780-7b050500-a380-11eb-85d4-7dc073b415f6.png)

### Step 3: Modify the _Alexa speech prompts_ and _User utterance_ sections. 

1) Add _How many calories would you consume per day?_ under Alexa speech prompts for the maxcalories slot and clik the + sign. Click Save Model.

2) Add _I can't live without {maxcalories} per day_ under _User utterances_ and clik the + sign. Click Save Model. Let's review what we have seen so far.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9892791/116191131-cc532280-a6f9-11eb-9bc0-c2e9b09515d8.png)

### Step 4: Modify the Skill's Backend processing code
In this section, we will make adjustments to the backend processing....


1) Click code under the _Code_ menu. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9892791/116191830-f6f1ab00-a6fa-11eb-8aef-e9ef334ebe91.png)

2) Review _index.js_ in the lambda folder. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9892791/116192106-62d41380-a6fb-11eb-9918-e8e9b882cfba.png)


3) Copy and paste the snippets marked under the lines //copy from here and //copy until here under async handle(handlerInput) and async function getData(diet,maxcalories). Note : You would basically find these two functions empty with just the {} braces in the code you imported from github, under which you would place these snippets. 
You are now writing code to get the inputs _maxcalories_ and _diet_ type from the user and then calling the getData(diet,maxcalories) function to call the Generate Meal Plan Spoonacular API. 

```
 async handle(handlerInput) {
//copy from here
    const maxcalories =
      handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.slots.maxcalories.value;
    const diet   =
      handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.slots.diet.value;
    let speakOutput = "";
    await getData(diet,maxcalories)
      .then((response) => {
        speakOutput = `Okay, you can have these 3 dishes for the day :1) ${response["meals"][0]["servings"]} servings of ${response["meals"][0]["title"]} :2) ${response["meals"][1]["servings"]} servings of ${response["meals"][1]["title"]} :3)  ${response["meals"][2]["servings"]} servings of ${response["meals"][2]["title"]} `;
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.log(err);
        speakOutput = `I could not generate a meal plan for your choices. Please try again.`;
      });
    return handlerInput.responseBuilder.speak(speakOutput).getResponse();
//copy until here
  }
```

```

async function getData(diet,maxcalories) {
//copy from here
  var options = {
    uri: `https://api.spoonacular.com/mealplanner/generate?timeFrame=day&diet=${diet}&maxcalories=${maxcalories}&apiKey=PUTYOURAPIKEYHERE`,
    json: true,
  };

  var response = await rp(options);
  return response;
//copy until here
}

```

4) Get the API key specific to your user account under Profile section of the Spoonacular dashboard.

5) Replace 'PUTYOURKEYHERE' in the getData function with your API key.

### Step 5: Save and Build the model

1) Click _Save_ at the top right of the page to save changes made in _index.js_. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9892791/116344330-0d0f7200-a7b4-11eb-9bb9-de1709762c61.png)


2) Click _Deploy_ to build the model.

Let's understand what we have done so far.

### Step 6: Test your Meal Planning Skill. 
It is time to test! 

1) Click  _Test_ tab to begin testing your skill.

2) Make sure skill testing is enabled. Select Development in the drop down box in the top left

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9892791/116346703-c1ab9280-a7b8-11eb-9fd8-6221a505b7fe.png)

3) You can test by typing what the user would say in the box at the top left of the Alexa Simulator, or you can speak to the skill by clicking and holding the microphone icon and speaking.

4) Test the skill using the invocation options you entered under _Alexa speech prompts_ and _User utterances_ for the _maxcalories_ slot.

## Wrap-up

At this point, your skill has become slightly more nuanced. It can ask the user for a meal plan options and respond with some  options. Congratulations!

However, while your skill can ask for a user's meal plan option, your skill doesn't remember it the next time the skill is opened. It would be a better user experience if Meal Planner remembered the selected plan. You can make your skill remember things by persisting responses with AWS database or storage services in the backend. We don't cover persistence is in this workshop but you are welcome to try it on your own following an existing Alexa tutorial.
